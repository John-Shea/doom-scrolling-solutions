156,The Lost King,(2022),77,"Critics Consensus: The movie's curiously bland compared to the remarkable real-life story it dramatizes, but Sally Hawkins' performance saves The Lost King from feeling like a royal disappointment."
157,Scream VI,(2023),76,"Critics Consensus: Certain aspects of horror's most murderously meta franchise may be going stale, but a change of setting and some inventive set pieces help keep Scream VI reasonably sharp."
158,A Haunting in Venice,(2023),76,"Critics Consensus: A darker and spookier spin on Branagh's Poirot, A Haunting in Venice is a decent Halloween snack whose undemanding mystery gets a lift from nifty visuals and an all-star cast."
159,"Red, White & Royal Blue",(2023),76,"Critics Consensus: Amusing and endearing, Red, White & Royal Blue is a cheerfully formulaic rom-com that embraces inclusion without falling back on stereotypes."
160,The Lesson,(2023),76,"Critics Consensus: Even if it isn't always quite as clever as it seems to think it is, sharp performances from an outrageously talented cast make The Lesson worth learning."
161,Sitting in Bars with Cake,(2023),75,"Critics Consensus: A well-acted if slightly formulaic story of friendship, Sitting in Bars with Cake moves between laughter and tears without succumbing to melodrama."
162,Asteroid City,(2023),75,"Critics Consensus: Asteroid City is unlikely to win Wes Anderson many new converts, but those who respond to his signature style will find this a return to immaculately arranged form."
163,Leave the World Behind,(2023),75,"Critics Consensus: An exceptionally well-acted apocalyptic thriller, Leave the World Behind steadily draws the viewer in despite its leisurely pace and somewhat simplistic messaging."
164,Strange Way of Life,(2023),76,"Critics Consensus: A tantalizing glimpse of the bond between two people, the well-acted Strange Way of Life adds a brief but still rewarding chapter to Pedro Almodóvar's filmography."
165,Moving On,(2022),75,"Critics Consensus: Moving On fails frustratingly often to rise to the level of its leads, but Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are entertaining company regardless of the context."
166,The Offering,(2022),74,"Critics Consensus: Within the outline of its fairly standard story, The Offering puts a unique -- and often genuinely scary -- spin on demonic possession horror tropes."
167,The Inventor,(2023),74,"Critics Consensus: A beautifully animated history lesson, The Inventor seems somewhat uncertain as to which audience it's trying to reach, but it remains amusing and often engaging."
168,Elemental,(2023),73,"Critics Consensus: Elemental may not satisfy as fully as the greatest Pixar pictures, but it remains a solid story told with dazzling visual flair."
169,Medusa Deluxe,(2022),72,"Critics Consensus: A uniquely stylish whodunit, Medusa Deluxe positions debuting director/co-writer Thomas Hardiman as a talented filmmaker with exciting potential."
